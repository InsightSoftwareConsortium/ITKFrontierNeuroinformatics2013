  abstract ={Background Most scientific journals practise anonymous peer
    review.
      There is no evidence, however, that this is any better than an open
      system.Aims To evaluate the feasibility of an open peer review
      system.Method Reviewers for the British Journal of Psychiatry were
      asked whether they would agree to have their name revealed to the
      authors
      whose papers they review; 408 manuscripts assigned to reviewers who
      agreed
      were randomised to signed or unsigned groups. We measured review
      quality,
    tone, recommendation for publication and time taken to complete each
      review.Results A total of 245 reviewers (76\%) agreed to sign. Signed
      reviews were of higher quality, were more courteous and took longer to
      complete than unsigned reviews. Reviewers who signed were more likely to
      recommend publication.Conclusions This study supports the feasibility of
      an open peer
      review system and identifies such a system's potential drawbacks.},
