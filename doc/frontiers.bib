  abstract ={Background Most scientific journals practise anonymous peer
    review.
      There is no evidence, however, that this is any better than an open
      system.Aims To evaluate the feasibility of an open peer review
      system.Method Reviewers for the British Journal of Psychiatry were
      asked whether they would agree to have their name revealed to the
      authors
      whose papers they review; 408 manuscripts assigned to reviewers who
      agreed
      were randomised to signed or unsigned groups. We measured review
      quality,
    tone, recommendation for publication and time taken to complete each
      review.Results A total of 245 reviewers (76\%) agreed to sign. Signed
      reviews were of higher quality, were more courteous and took longer to
      complete than unsigned reviews. Reviewers who signed were more likely to
      recommend publication.Conclusions This study supports the feasibility of
      an open peer
      review system and identifies such a system's potential drawbacks.},

	abstract = {Journal policy on research data and code availability is an important part of the ongoing shift toward publishing reproducible computational science. This article extends the literature by studying journal data sharing policies by year (for both 2011 and 2012) for a referent set of 170 journals. We make a further contribution by evaluating code sharing policies, supplemental materials policies, and open access status for these 170 journals for each of 2011 and 2012. We build a predictive model of open data and code policy adoption as a function of impact factor and publisher and find higher impact journals more likely to have open data and code policies and scientific societies more likely to have open data and code policies than commercial publishers. We also find open data policies tend to lead open code policies, and we find no relationship between open data and code policies and either supplemental material policies or open access journal status. Of the journals in this study, 38\% had a data policy, 22\% had a code policy, and 66\% had a supplemental materials policy as of June 2012. This reflects a striking one year increase of 16\% in the number of data policies, a 30\% increase in code policies, and a 7\% increase in the number of supplemental materials policies. We introduce a new dataset to the community that categorizes data and code sharing, supplemental materials, and open access policies in 2011 and 2012 for these 170 journals.},

    abstract = {{Three-dimensional atlases and databases of the brain at different ages facilitate the description of neuroanatomy and the monitoring of cerebral growth and development. Brain segmentation is challenging in young children due to structural differences compared to adults. We have developed a method, based on established algorithms, for automatic segmentation of young children's brains into 83 regions of interest (ROIs), and applied this to an exemplar group of 33 2-year-old subjects who had been born prematurely. The algorithm uses prior information from 30 normal adult brain magnetic resonance (MR) images, which had been manually segmented to create 30 atlases, each labeling 83 anatomical structures. Each of these adult atlases was registered to each 2-year-old target MR image using non-rigid registration based on free-form deformations. Label propagation from each adult atlas yielded a segmentation of each 2-year-old brain into 83 ROIs. The final segmentation was obtained by combination of the 30 propagated adult atlases using decision fusion, improving accuracy over individual propagations. We validated this algorithm by comparing the automatic approach with three representative manually segmented volumetric regions (the subcortical caudate nucleus, the neocortical pre-central gyrus and the archicortical hippocampus) using similarity indices (SI), a measure of spatial overlap (intersection over average). SI results for automatic versus manual segmentations for these three structures were 0.90+/-0.01, 0.90+/-0.01 and 0.88+/-0.03 respectively. This registration approach allows the rapid construction of automatically labelled age-specific brain atlases for children at the age of 2 years.}},
