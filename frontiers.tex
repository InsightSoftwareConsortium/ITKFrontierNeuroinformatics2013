The essential feature of the scientific method is the practice of verification
of reproducibility.

This verification is better performed by independent parties, and to be
trustable, it must be performed multiple times. These are the essential
principles that guided the establishment of the early scientific societies in
the 17th century, such as the Royal Society and the Lincean Academy.

The Motto of the Royal Society:  “Nullius in Verba” roughly translates as “Take
nobody’s word for it”, and “...it is an expression of the determination of
Fellows to withstand the domination of authority and to verify all statements
by an appeal to facts determined by experiment”. It was this approach to
scientific research what triggered the enlightenment of the 17th century.

Unfortunately today, the economics of how we fund modern science had led
research organizations to discard the true practice of the scientific method
and instead engage in practices that are closer to the marketing and branding
of manufactured products. Instead of attention to the practice of
reproducibility verification, Journals and Conferences have obsessed with
Novelty. Journals and Conferences have confused their mission of dissemination
of scientific information with an attempt to play the role of a surrogate of
the patent office.

In the process, Journals and Conferences have confused the profession of
scientific researcher with the profession of inventor. These are indeed two
very different vocations, although it is common to find them intermixed when
researchers express traits of invention in the process of crafting the methods
and tools that are needed to further their scientific quest. for example
Antonie Leeuwenhoek behave as a scientist when making the first observation of
micro-organisms in 1665, and behave as an inventor when crafting the unique
microscopes that he used for his observations. The duality of these two
profession is quite clearly illustrated in this case by the fact that
Leeuwenhoek generously share the findings of his observations of
microorganisms, but kept secret the technical details of the construction of
his microscopes. As a consequence, his scientific work gave birth to the field
of microbiology, while his microscope building techniques were taken with him
to his grave, and it took 150 years for microscopes of similar quality to be
re-developed.

The large majority of research activity today is focused on generating novelty,
and only in exceptional cases, concerned with the verification of
reproducibility. The practice of peer-review has been assumed to be a suitable
replacement for the verification of reproducibility. A mistake by which
experimental work has been replaced by thought experiments and opinion-based
evaluations that do little to further the scientific enterprise. This drift has
denigrated, what used to be scientific work, back into the practice of the
“natural philosophy” in which we simply imagine models of the natural word and
evaluate them based on aesthetic appeals and desire of self-consistency.

The Insight Toolkit (ITK) has made possible to restore the true practice of the
scientific method in the field of medical image analysis. By providing a common
platform in which image analysis algorithms and processing techniques can be
implemented and can be freely disseminated. ITK empowers all to verify the
experimental work of image analysis research activities. This of course, to
requires that researchers adhere to the true practice of the scientific method
and publish the full details of their methodology, including the source code,
data, parameters and auxiliary documents that are required for a third party to
independently repeat the work and verify the findings.

The ITK community created in 2005 a scientific journal, truly fulfilling the
practice of the scientific method, where all articles are required to provide
the full set of source code, data and parameters needed to reproduce the
finding of the authors. These materials are immediately made available to
readers and reviewers, empowering them to indeed perform such verification with
minimal effort and minimal losses of information.

Other Journals, in particular Frontiers, PLoS, and more recently Nature, have
embraced this restoration of the true practice of the scientific method.  With
the support of the Reproducible Research movement, these progressive
publication venues are creating the conditions for a new age of enlightenment
in which the methodologies of practical research work will not be subject to
secrecy, nor be subject to the veil of suspicion that many incidents of
scientific fraud, and data manufacturing that have left us with in recent
months.

The open source nature of ITK, the open access nature of the Insight Journal,
and the public sharing of open data that is enabled by the Midas Platform in
the ITK community, are the three pillars of Open Science that are transforming
the way scientific research is done today.

The technological challenges of reproducibility have all been solved. We now
require a cultural change by which we must make simply unacceptable that any
article in the domain of medical image analysis be published without the full
set of source code, data and parameters that will enable an independent group
to replicate the process and verify or refute the findings.

\section{Results}

Frontiers requires figures to be submitted individually, in the same order as they are referred to in the manuscript. Figures will then be automatically embedded at the bottom of the submitted manuscript. Kindly ensure that each table and figure is mentioned in the text and in numerical order. Permission must be obtained for use of copyrighted material from other sources (including the web). Please note that it is compulsory to follow figure instructions. Figures which are not according to the guidelines will cause substantial delay during the production process.
